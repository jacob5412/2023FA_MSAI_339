# Homework 3: Data Pipelines

## MongoDB

1. Figure out what the schema of the collection is.

```javascript
> db.embedded_movies.find().limit(1)

< {
  _id: ObjectId("573a1390f29313caabcd5293"),
  plot: "Young Pauline is left a lot of money when her wealthy uncle dies. However, her uncle's secretary has been named as her guardian until she marries, at which time she will officially take ...",
  genres: [
    'Action'
  ],
  runtime: 199,
  cast: [
    'Pearl White',

  title: 'The Perils of Pauline',
  fullplot: `Young Pauline is left a lot of money when her wealthy uncle dies. However, her uncle's secretary has been named as her guardian until she marries, at which time she will officially take possession of her inheritance. Meanwhile, her "guardian" and his confederates constantly come up with schemes to get rid of Pauline so that he can get his hands on the money himself.`,

2. Query that captures the following requirements:
   1. Movies with `year` between 1975 and 1980.
   2. Display only 3 columns `title`, `year` and `runtime`.
   3. Order by `runtime` (asc or dsc).
   4. Display the top 5 results.

The following displays the first 5 results in ascending order of runtime:

```javascript
> db.embedded_movies.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      year: { $gte: 1975, $lte: 1980 }
    }
  },
  {
    $sort: { runtime: 1 }
  },
  {
    $limit: 5
  },
  {
    $project: {
      title: 1,
      year: 1,
      runtime: 1,
      _id: 0
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      title: "$title",
      year: "$year",
      runtime: "$runtime"
    }
  }
])
```

The output from the MongoDB compass:

There's a script called `retrieve_movies.js` that can be run using `node`. Ensure that you create a file called `db_creds.json` before you run the file. The output is given in `movies_query_results.json`, this includes all the movies without any limit.

The following displays the top 5 as ranked outputs in ascending order of runtime:

```bash
> db.embedded_movies.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      year: { $gte: 1975, $lte: 1980 }
    }
  },
  {
    $setWindowFields: {
      sortBy: { runtime: 1 },
      output: {
        rankRuntime: {
          $denseRank: {}
        }
      }
    }
  },
  {
    $match: {
      rankRuntime: { $lte: 5 }
  }
  },
  {
    $sort: {
      rankRuntime: 1
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      title: 1,
      year: 1,
      runtime: 1,
      _id: 0
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      title: "$title",
      year: "$year",
      runtime: "$runtime"
    }
  }
])
```

3. Write an aggregation aggregating year which calculates sum of all runtime for movies where year is between 1975 and 1980 (inclusive).
   
```bash
> db.embedded_movies.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      year: { $gte: 1975, $lte: 1980 }
    }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$year",
      sumRuntime: { $sum: "$runtime" }
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 0,
      year: "$_id",
      sumRuntime: "$sumRuntime"
    }
  }
]).sort({ year: 1 })
```

If we're considering top 5 by rank, then we get:

```python
import pyspark.sql.functions as F
from pyspark.sql.window import Window

window_spec = Window.orderBy("age", "education_num")
df = df.withColumn("DenseRank", F.dense_rank().over(window_spec))
display(df[df['DenseRank'] <= 5])
